        <li><p>In 1994, <i>HTML 2</i> was released by Dan Connolly. Dan took all the popular and <br> most widely used tags in HTML and put them in <i>HTML 2</i>. Later in the same<br> year, a group was formed called "The World Wide Web Consortium." Eight<br> people made up the group. Dave Raggott worked on HTML. Arnaud Le Hors<br> worked on HTML. Dan Connolly as well worked on HTML. Hypertext Transfer<br> Protocol (HTTP) was worked on by Henrik Frystyk Nielson. Hakon Lie was<br> working on style sheets. Bert Bos was working on style sheets and layouts. Jim<br>  Miller was looking at the technologies. Chris Lilley, the last man of the group,<br>  worked on style sheets and fonts. In 1995, RBgcolor, font styles,<br>  background-colors, and text colors were new HTML tags they added. </p></li>
