                    <li><p>In 1989, Tim Berners-Lee invented the web using <i>Hyper Text Markup Language</i>.<br>
                         He uses Standard Generalized Markup Language as a base in <i>HTML 1</i>. The title <br> tag was taken from SGML and was put into his <i> HTML</i>. Tags such as P, H1, H2,<br> H3, H4, H5, H6, ol, li, ul, etc. were elements that were taken from SGML and<br> used in <i>HTML</i>. HREF and the "a" tag were invented by Tim so you can use<br> hyperlinks within the web. David Raggett took great interest in Tim's <i> HTML</i>.<br> He ended up visting Tim, and he created HTML+ which is technically a better<br>version of <i>HTML</i>.</p></li>
