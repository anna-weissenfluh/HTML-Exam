                <ul>
                    <li><p>In 1989, Tim Berners-Lee invented the web using Hyper Text Markup Language. He uses Standard Generalized Markup Language as a base in Html. The title tage was taken from SGML and was put into his HTML. Tags such as P, H1, H2, H3, H4, H5, H6, ol, li, ul, etc. were elements that were taken from SGML and used in HTML. HREF and the "a" tag were invented by Tim so you can use hyperlinks within the web. David Raggett took great interest in Tim's HTML. He ended up visting Tim, and he created HTML+ which is technically a better version of HTML.</p></li>

            <li><h3>HTML 2</h3></li>
                <ul>
                    <li><p>In 1994, HTML 2 was released by Dan Connolly. Dan took all the popular and most widely used tags in HTML and put them in HTML 2. Later in the same year, a group was formed called "The World Wide Web Consortium." Eight people made up the group. Dave Raggott worked on HTML. Arnaud Le Hors worked on HTML. Dan Connolly as well worked on HTML. Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) was worked on by Henrik Frystyk Nielson. Hakon Lie was working on style sheets. Bert Bos was working on style sheets and layouts. Jim Miller was looking at the technologies. Chris Lilley, the last man of the group, worked on style sheets and fonts. In 1995, RBgcolor, font styles, background-colors, and text colors were new HTML tags they added. </p></li>

            <li><h3>HTML 3</h3></li>
                <ul>
                    <li><p>In March of 1995, HTML 3 emerged. It was published in a document. HTML 3 added many new tags. One of the new tags were changing the img tag to a fig tag. Dave Raggett added the style tag and class attributes to HTML 3. He also wokred on adding tables, forms, tabs, and footnotes. Two years later, HTML 3.2 was published. Better tables were added, applets, text-flow around images, subscripts and superscripts.</p></li>
