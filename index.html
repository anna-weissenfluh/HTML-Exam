                    <li><p>In 1989, Tim Berners-Lee invented the web using Hyper Text Markup Language. He uses Standard Generalized Markup Language as a base in Html. The title tage was taken from SGML and was put into his HTML. Tags such as P, H1, H2, H3, H4, H5, H6, ol, li, ul, etc. were elements that were taken from SGML and used in HTML. HREF and the "a" tag were invented by Tim so you can use hyperlinks within the web. David Raggett took great interest in Tim's HTML. He ended up visting Tim, and he created HTML+ which is technically a better version of HTML.</p></li>
